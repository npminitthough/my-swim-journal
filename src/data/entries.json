        "description": "Today I went to my first Swim Dr session. I learned to get my head under water by holding on to the edge and bending my knees. The instructor, Brice, said the goal was to get my whole face under water. I'm happy that I managed this quite quickly. I learned to stay calm whilst breathing out in the water. Then I progressed to lifting my feet and breathing face down in the water. I learned that you need to just blink the water out of your eyes whilst breathing in and then put your face in the water again. I had a tendency to stop, wipe my face and go again. Then the instructor got me to do the same but start kicking my feet and gave me a float. It was a challenge to think about staying calm and breathing and also kick my feet. I feel that my legs aren;t strong so they get tired quickly. The instructor said you learn to kick in your own way like leaving a baby to learn how to walk. I think Brice is a good teacher and managed all the students well despite us all working on different things and at different levels. I want to commit to going on a Wednesday morning 3 times a month."
