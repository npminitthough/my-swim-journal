        "description": "Today I went to my first Swim Dr session. I learned to get my head under water by holding on to the edge and bending my knees. The instructor, Brice, said the goal was to get my whole face under water. I'm happy that I managed this quite quickly. I learned to stay calm whilst breathing out in the water. Then I progressed to lifting my feet and breathing face down in the water. I learned that you need to just blink the water out of your eyes whilst breathing in and then put your face in the water again. I had a tendency to stop, wipe my face and go again. Then the instructor got me to do the same but start kicking my feet and gave me a float. It was a challenge to think about staying calm and breathing and also kick my feet. I feel that my legs aren;t strong so they get tired quickly. The instructor said you learn to kick in your own way like leaving a baby to learn how to walk. I think Brice is a good teacher and managed all the students well despite us all working on different things and at different levels. I want to commit to going on a Wednesday morning 3 times a month."

        "description": "Kicking was a lot easier for me this week! At first my legs were getting tired but I told myself to relax them and tune into what was working. I kind of kicked from the knees down whilst being concious of making the chain of movement begin from the hips. Breathing and kicking at the same type were challenging but I managed to do couple of half lengths without stopping. At the end of the session the teacher got us all to practice treading in the deep end. I had a noodle and stayed at the edge. It was nice. He said keep your chin above the water and march like a soldier."
